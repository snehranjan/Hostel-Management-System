# 🏫 Hostel Management System (C++ Project)

## 📌 Overview
The **Hostel Management System** is a console-based application developed entirely in **C++**.  
Its main goal is to simplify the management of hostel records such as student registration,  and check-in/out management.  

This project is built as part of my **university coursework** for the C++ Programming subject, focusing on object-oriented design and real-world problem-solving using core C++ concepts.

In each line of code there are comments writtern which can help to understand the concept and the syntax used by the the developer's in a easy manner.
